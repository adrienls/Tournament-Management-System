# Tournament-Management-System
A project from Alexis Decamp, Arthur Guerineau and Adrien Le Saux

## Aim of the project
The aim of the project is to create a website to dynamically manage different tournaments.
The general idea is to be able to create tournaments with each a specific number of teams that will all face each other. We can then obtain the ranking of the teams by tournament, the calendar, the results of the matches, etc. The information will be dynamically accessible from your web browser, so the data will be stored in a database and retrieved at the request of the user. The system will have two access points. The "Front-end", intended for the visitors of the website, and the "Back-end", reserved for the administrators who will organize the tournaments "CRUD" (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
